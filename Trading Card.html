			<p>These fantastic predators prey on other birds such as hawks and eagles. They can be found all over the world, seeking mostly higher grounds for their nesting. Like most winged creatures, these falcons migrate south for winter and can be seen as far as South America. Between the 1950s and 1970s, Peregrines were classified as an endangered species.</p>
